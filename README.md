## Summary
By comparing the results from both months of the year, we can observe that there is a fair weather pattern that does not stray much throughout the year. Now even though temperature can be said to be steady it does not take into account precipitation, which can be another query to look into. we can further investigate and look at the precipitation data of for the months of June and December for the year 2017. This can give us better insight as to where the locale for the establisment should be located.
